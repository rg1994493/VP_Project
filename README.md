# VP_Project
## Vision and perception class project

### Objective:
 - Solve a lane detection problem using a Deep Learning approach
 - Use different CNN models to get an effcient accuracy detecting lanes in multiple road images
 - Use a Google Colab notebook to create the program

### Dataset: 
KITTI-Road/Lane Detection Evaluation 2013
