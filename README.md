# VP_Project
## Vision and perception class project

### Objective:
 - Solve a Road/lane detection problem using a Deep Learning approach based on image semantic segmentation
 - Use different CNN models to get an effcient accuracy detecting lanes in multiple road images
 - Use a Google Colab notebook to create the program

### Dataset: 
KITTI-Road/Lane Detection Evaluation 2013

The code presented here is a Google Colab notebook, to run it:
- Make sure that you have the images of the dataset uploaded in your drive
- Run the notebook step by step
- If you want to try the models already saved, skip the training segments and go directly to the "load model" part.
